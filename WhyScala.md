Why Scala - Vincent KUBICKI - 2017

# Abstract

This document summarizes the experience of doign numerical computations in Scala. It is based on my experience coding this library. I will not include external ressources or researches.

# Pro

- Once the code is written and compiles, it is highly likely to be correct and show a minimum of runtime bugs

# Cons
